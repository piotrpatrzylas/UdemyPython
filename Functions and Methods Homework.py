# Write a Python function that accepts a string and calculates the number of upper case letters and lower case letters.
# Sample String : 'Hello Mr. Rogers, how are you this fine Tuesday?'
# Expected Output :
# No. of Upper case characters : 4
# No. of Lower case Characters : 33
# HINT: Two string methods that might prove useful: .isupper() and .islower()
# If you feel ambitious, explore the Collections module to solve this problem!

# Write a Python function that takes a list and returns a new list with unique elements of the first list.

# Write a Python function that checks whether a passed in string is palindrome or not.

# Hard:
# Write a Python function to check whether a string is pangram or not.
# Note : Pangrams are words or sentences containing every letter of the alphabet at least once.
# For example : "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"
# Hint: Look at the string module
